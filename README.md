# Interactive Quiz Platform

This project is an interactive quiz platform built with React, offering users an engaging experience to test their knowledge.  It features quiz creation and management, real-time feedback, progress tracking, and local data persistence.

## Features

*   **Quiz Display:** Presents a list of questions in a clear and user-friendly format.  Questions are loaded from the provided `sample_quiz.pdf` (see setup instructions for details on how to integrate this).
*   **Multiple Attempts:** Allows users to take quizzes multiple times, providing opportunities for improvement.
*   **Attempt History:**  Tracks and displays the history of quiz attempts, enabling users to review their past performance.
*   **Instant Feedback:** Provides immediate feedback after each answer selection, indicating whether the choice was correct or incorrect.
*   **Timer-Based Quizzes:** Implements a timer for each question (e.g., 30 seconds), adding a time constraint to enhance the challenge.
*   **Scoreboard:** Displays a scoreboard at the end of each quiz, summarizing the user's performance.
*   **Local Data Persistence (Bonus):**  Saves quiz history and progress using IndexedDB, allowing users to access their data even offline.

## Technologies Used

*   React
*   (Potentially other libraries you use, e.g., for state management, UI components, etc.  List them here.)

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)  # Replace with your repo URL
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd interactive-quiz-platform
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install
    ```

4.  **Integrate Quiz Questions (`sample_quiz.pdf`):**

    *   **Important:** This project uses a `sample_quiz.pdf` file for quiz questions. You'll need to convert this PDF into a format that your React application can understand (e.g., JSON).
    *   **Recommended Approach:** Use a PDF parsing library (e.g., `pdf-parse` in Node.js) to extract the question data from `sample_quiz.pdf` and save it as a JSON file (e.g., `quiz_data.json`).
    *   **Place the JSON file:** Place the generated `quiz_data.json` file in a suitable location within your project (e.g., `src/data/quiz_data.json`).
    *   **Import in React:** Import this JSON file into your React component where you render the quiz questions.

    ```javascript
    // Example (in your Quiz component)
    import quizData from './data/quiz_data.json'; // Adjust path as needed

    // ... use quizData in your component ...
    ```

5.  **Start the Development Server:**

    ```bash
    npm start  # or yarn start
    ```

    This will start the development server and open the app in your browser.
